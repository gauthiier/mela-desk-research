The project uses familiar social networking technology to digitally \'repatriate\' objects from Sierra Leone that are now in museums across the world. \'The problem is that those institutions, such as Sierra Leone\'s National Museum, which might lead such cultural renaissance, have themselves suffered from chronic neglect and have few resources and little expertise. At the same time there is a wealth of Sierra Leonean material culture and associated scholarship dispersed in the world\'s museums. This project is concerned with exploring how these \'diasporas\' of objects and knowledges can again become meaningful resources for Sierra Leoneans who currently have no access to them.\'","\'Whereas the practice of \'digital repatriation\' has become increasingly popular with museums, the reception of such initiatives by source communities has not been critically assessed. Thus, a crucial part of the project is to employ innovative participatory methods to pilot and evaluate the digital resource in Sierra Leone.\'","\'As well as its impact in Sierra Leone, the research will inform museum policy-making more widely, exemplify how museums can play a role in strengthening international relations, and provide a platform for future research and capacity building initiatives.

The reflection is stimulated through the continuous juxtaposition of different stories, different objects, celebrations following a multicultural approach: showing together very diverse items of faith such as a necklace with cross, a picture of Mary, a Sabbath menorah and a statuette of Buddha represents the multicultural and multi-religious contemporary Switzerland.
At the same time other stations show a more intercultural approach exposing objects and celebrations that represent the interconnections among different cultures even if not always positive: the Hindu god represented on the Migros shopping bag speaks of interconnections among cultures but also of a clash among cultures.
A matter of faith is a continuous representation of religious identities and memories but, at the same time, it questions about religious identity, inducing visitors to reflect about different practises and about their religious identity: the last station, in particular, helps people to re-cluster themselves within five types of religious approach overcoming the starting dichotomy believer / not believer.

When it finds such a phrase, it records the full sentence and identifies the \""feeling\"" expressed in that sentence (e.g. sad, happy, depressed, etc.). The age, gender, and geographical location of the author can often be extracted from the blog. These are saved alongside local weather conditions at the time the sentence was written. Because blogs are structured in largely standard ways, the age, gender, and geographical location of the author can often be extracted and saved along with the sentence, as can the local weather conditions at the time the sentence was written. All of this information is saved. The result is a database of several million human feelings, increasing by 15,000 - 20,000 new feelings per day. Using a series of playful interfaces, the feelings can be searched and sorted across a number of demographic slices, offering responses to specific questions like: do Europeans feel sad more often than Americans? Do women feel fat more often than men? Does rainy weather affect how we feel? What are the most representative feelings of female New Yorkers in their 20s? What do people feel right now in Baghdad? What were people feeling on Valentine\'s Day? Which are the happiest cities in the world? The saddest? And so on. The interface to this data is a self-organizing particle system, where each particle represents a single feeling posted by a single individual. The particles\' properties – color, size, shape, opacity – indicate the nature of the feeling inside, and any particle can be clicked to reveal the full sentence or photograph it contains. The particles careen wildly around the screen until asked to self-organize along any number of axes, expressing various pictures of human emotion.

Items published on Open Images and the accompanying descriptions (metadata) are accessible through an Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).

In cooperation with Wikimedia Netherlands, Open Images continuously contributes audiovisual content to Wikimedia Commons (and is currently responsible for over 11% of the video content on Wikimedia Commons). OAI-PMH-based technology has been developed to fully automate the ingestion process from Open Images to Wikimedia Commons. Already, hundres of items from Open Images have been uploaded and a large proportion of them are used to enrich over 550 textual Wikipedia entries with related audiovisual content.

“Tuned Stairway”. On each step of the staircase that leads to the exhibition a sensor connected to a microprocessor and a speaker is installed. As soon as the visitor places his foot on the step, a sampled sound from a destructured metallophone is played. Visitors are there allowed to compose their own music, individually or in groups, as they descend the stairs.
“We are the Time. We are the Famous”. The visitor comes into contact and interacts with two images of himself in real time. An image in slow motion confuses the perception of time as a photo during the development process, the other image, however, fragmented into a series of time frames, like a celluloid film that moves along the wall. On one wall the viewer is invited to stand still to see clearly his own reflection, while the other is stimulated to move to animate the sequence. The installation describes two ways to be represented in time: the photographic image and the fixed film sequence. The time is experienced directly and simultaneously by the viewer as a stream and a series of points.
“Dialogs”. Dialogs is an interactive multimedia installation that explores the relationships and the lack of communication between people. In a room bathed in semi-darkness, a hypothetical conversation is staged: the viewpoint and the words of each speaker are represented by a bright display on a row of panels. To understand both the points of view, one must move and find a precise position between to the panels. Each display is connected to an audio system audible only in a certain position to emphasize the difficulties of communication and mutual understanding in all interpersonal relationships and the need to change the point of view to understand and communicate with each other.
“Stock Exchange of Visions”. The Stock Exchange of Visions interactive installation invites visitors to reflect on the future. The screens allow to see a series of interviews with artists, scientists, sociologists, futurologists, who face all sorts of topics, from ecology to economy and scientific research, to meet the most pressing issues on the future of the planet. An updated real-time display shows a diagram of the topics most requested by visitors. Stock Exchange of Visions will also develop on the Internet with a website, to create a global network of \""visions\"" essential for humanity\'s future.
“10 x 10” (West-Middle East-Far East)  is an interactive exploration of pictures and words that define our time. The result is often moving, sometimes shocking, occasionally frivolous, but it still provides an eloquent snapshot of our time. Every hour, 10x10 collects the 100 most important words and images in the world, presenting them as one image able to fix that particular moment in time. During the days, months and years, 10x10 leaves a trail of slots which records a continuous patchwork of humanity. 
\""Fabrica\"" Virtual Virtual Fabrica is a  Quake-like experience which allows to take a virtual tour in the location of Fabrica, through a three-dimensional space that reproduces every detail of the building designed by Tadao Ando. 
“FLIPBOOK!” Winner of the Grand Prize at the prestigious Japan Media Arts Festival, FLIPBOOK! (http://www.fabrica.it/flipbook/) is a relational-artistic tool designed by a young Colombian web artist - Juan Ospina - who can draw, send and share animations online. From this project stemmed a creative community that nurtures the sharing of thousands of short stories, some simple and fun, others violent, painful or erotic. FLIPBOOK! quickly became a web phenomenon with over 200,000 animations and 15 million visitors.

The design brief was to create an installation that a)highlighted different forms of participation in the Great North Run over the past thirty years, b) extended notions of what it means to take part in the event and c) supported personal reflection and contribution to a collective shared experience and user-generated archive.

The BibPhone prototype enables children to annotate physical material with digital recordings. Children are able to add oral comments to books by placing the BibPhone over a RFID tag on the book. Putting an ear to the book enables hearing the comments recorded by others. The concept originated from children’s reluctance towards doing written reviews, and the fact that more and more libraries are adopting RFID technology on information material. The BibPhone can be used for treasure hunting for messages in books or enabling children to have a secret information layer attached to selected books.

The exhibition presents the black boxes where there are the video-interviews (visualprojections) about people from around the world: 5000 interviews in 75 countries by 6 director looking for “The Other”. The interviews are based on 40 questions about what joins and what divides the people: from the brazilian fisherman to chinese shopkeeper, from the german actor to the afghan fermers. They all answered the same questions about the meaning of the love, the spiritual heritage of the parents, the fear, the dreams, the difficulties, the hopness.....
Also these interviews are collected in a web archive as a “recorder” for the web users that can uploade and share own testimony.
The exhibition is itinerant but the first one took place in Paris at Grand Palais, with a kind of exhibition very schenographic and particular. But in the others places, was proposed an exhibition more abstract throught the introduction the black boxes. The first display system was made up by the mongolian tents made of wood and textile. Inside were the videoprojections. So the Grand Palais building is transformed in the blue sky and the yurts would host the nomad public the discovery of all trips. The meetings are in the intimacy of the yurts but also in the others parts of the “camp”. The visitors were encouraged to continue the conversations in the small squares and in the bar of the village. Everybody can share the discussions and interact with the questions worldwide.
The interesting aspect about the culture topic is in the comparison of values of the several interviews: there are identifiable constants that we can find in every ethnic group and variables typical of the place. The interview is the principal tool of this work. The subjects are framed in close up with fixed camera, here the variations of a director are reduced at minimum. In the exhibition the visitor is immersed in the black rooms with the projection. With the web archive we can listen to the interview or upload own testimony. We can search for the interviews also through key-words an topic-value. 
The choose of the director is the listening. The director propose to the public direct testimonies without filters. The choose to propose the same questions (archetypical and fundamental) underlines the cultural differences.
We have the video-portrait model represented through concepts and fundamental values of the life of the people and the communities to which they belong.
The people’s identity is made know and valorised through the emersion of their values.
In this case we have a multiple self-representation: all people have answered the same questions about the meaning of the love, the spiritual heredity of the parents, the fears, the dreams, the difficulties, the hopes...We choose a common language to communicate these contents: the frontal shooting and close up.
You can not talk about friction but about differences. The aim is to show the convergences, the archetypal values that across all populations and the differences that distinguish them. The contents are essential, absolutely common to every community. The public is very large, is “the Other”, is a people that like to know and to meet the people. Telling the different aspects of the human people, it is shown that the difference does not preclude the understanding, but it is necessary for the survival of the world.

On the other hand the web-archive user considers the web as an information channel, but also a form of the knowledge and exchange.
For to make the interviews uses a light videocamera, a tripod, two wired microphones: every reporter individually can manage the sound system.
In this exhibition is used the video-recording and the audiovisual projection. For a after-visit experience (or for an experience indipendent of the visit), is used the web channel as a knowledge platform and as identity’s valorisation and as exchange tool to upload own testimony (webcam).
In each room the permanence is 20’ for almost 15 rooms that we visit not sequentially but thematically. The consultation of the web-archive is variable considering the rich availability of contributions uploaded.
Device: the sight of the video-interviews is inside a black box that allows the presence of ten people more or less.
The mechanics of interaction is the sight and the listening.
We find the partecipative aspect in the web-archive where the user can contributes to database (so to contribute to portrait of the people and the stories) uploading own testimony. Only in the exhibition in Paris we had also a forum-place for debates about the topic. Again the studios there were available to the visitors to recorder own interviews in the same condition of the original project. To facilitate the understanding were built educational pre-visit paths. These allow an acquisition of knowledge about the contents of the exhibition.
This project leads to a knowledge of the identity of the Other and also to a valorisation of the contents and the elements collected through a process in progress: a globe of the shared values. The artistic code of the Yann Arthus-Bertrand, photographer-videomaker and artist of the video-interviews (before famous for an other work about the portrait of the Earth from above in its cultural-landscape elements) becomes the demonstration that the artistic-expressive language can be used to serve an enlarged community..
The questions are edited by Sibylle d’Orgeval and Baptiste Rouget-Luchaire and are the framework of the video-interviews digital recorded. They are visible in the exhibition and than they are uploaded (digitally again) on the web-archive. Also are digital the testimonies uploaded autonomously by web-users.
In this case the technologies used in the exhibition are not particularly innovative however are absolutely appropriate and effective for the transmission of these contents. Instead in the case of the web-archive the self-management of the webcam and the direct uploading allows an immediate implementation of the system.","Audience / Public - the application is outward facing, intended as an experience for the general public, or specific community groups","We can underline some replicable elements: from the point of view of the contents we focus on the specification of the universal and archetypal topics/values, common “territories” through which to underline different approaches, visions and traditions compared to the populations involved. From point of view of the language an other important and replicable aspect is to give way to the voice and to the face of the individual person as a special witness of a specific culture: so the individual-subjective contribution becomes “bearer” of common values to the specific community/ethnic group.","Knowledge of other cultures;

With Sensitive City, Italy decided tounderline a unique and very distinctive feature of its city, revealing the quality of its small and medium size centre by presenting an interactive experience which enables the visitor to entertain a relationship with the digital images of people who live in this cities by stopping them (in a virtual sense) as if on the street and the street and the listening to their comments.
Chioggia, Lucca, Matera, Spoleto, Siracusa and Trieste offer six opportunities to exchange views with their inhabitants and the space that surrounds them; a space that has not been subject to an exponential urban development and has instead preserved a large part of its architectural and hitorical past. The people however do not display that sense of alienation, so typical of the model metropolis. They are at ease with the space in which their story is couched and stand as spokesmer for “a good life” that is very typical of small Italian cities and town.
Over one humdred people were consulted for each location, with the intention of creating a collection of audio-visual portraits.
An imaginary city draw by a multitude of humble authors and organised around a complex relational system rather than by a draughtsmen can only be revealed by using the most novel forms of technologyand a new language.
Sensitive City is an environment, a work that only partially addrresses the needs of a city, but which intends to present a more dreamlike aspect of it: it seeks the poetic tone of Calvino’s invisible cities while also yeaming for the concreteness of a settlement that straddles a physical, real dimension and one that is more fantastic and intangible. The crowd that inhabits and passes through this environment is virtual, yet it preserves its own history, its own emotions and can react to real people, our spectators, when theym with a small gesture of relational responsibility, ask to become citizens.
The cultural aspect is manifest in the way to propose the identity’s elements of the places and also in the languages: the contens are passed on the visitors through “special witness”.  There are multimedia tools, in particular video-projections and sound suggestions that constitute the framework of the exhibitio
The visitor is present at direct oral testominies. Here the individual citizen’s story is prevalent. Every citizen communicates with own voice, own sensations, own sensibility. The historical, urban and traditonal culture is screened by a prosaic and poetic view at the same time.
The model is the city’s portrait through the multisensory sight of the citizens. During the visit appear in the projected images of human figures (people) that walk the visitor in the city. As the activated characters begin their narration the projected, images of the described journey also appear; they are drawings, short annotations, paths, often the very scribbles they narrators themselves have drawn in order to provide an exact description of where the narrated events take place. Video and graphic images. And while the places only appear for just a few seconds, the map persist and overlap with the next ones, expanded by the refractions of the prpjection glasses.
In this case we have a multiple self-representation: each person tells the local cultural identity about the own city but wih the principal target to take a significant photography of a specific urban italian context. This message is bent on a hetereogeneous, international/intercontinental public in a context (Shanghai) very far from the subject telled.

Each “story carrier” can be consulted, as he walks along, only if the visitor halts him or her with their hand, in which case they will turn towards them and begin their narration, which will last for as long as the hand will remain in contact with the projection surface.
The partecipatory component is present during all the exhibition’s visite through technological devices that enable to “control”, in part, the time, the ways and the quality of the experiencial path choosing what part the city to visite, wath character and the lenght.
This kind of the city’s portrait is a form of valorisation of the italian culture, so one the assets is to show a part of the “minor” Italy, main famous to tourism but very interesting.
In this case the technologies used consent an immersive partecipation in the environment of the exhibition. The visitor isn’t to direct contact with specific tools as “mediator” of the visit but whit the body and the behaviours he actives the devices that consent a strong dynamism and an absorbing experience.
Three large architectonical elements out of the walls of the exhibit place. Here there are walking non stop some video-characters through 3 videoprojectors. Through a ComputerVision system and infrared technologies the visitor can touch the digital images of the people, stop these and listen the voice. When the visitor leaves the touch these figures continue the path to come to the scenarios projected in the large walls.
Thanks to 6 videoprojectors the interactive system on the large surrounding scenarios can shows the stories of the characters surveyed through the visitor\'s gesture. So relationally a sensible and utopical map of the selected cities appears .

http://localprojects.net",,"City of Memory attempts to map stories, memories, imprecise recollections, tales of neighborhoods, and more related to New York City and its history, including video clips, images, and text-based stories. Some stories are curated by City Lore (represented by a blue dot), while others are submitted by website visitors (represented by an orange dot), although all entries are reviewed and may be deleted for inappropriate or crude content: the site was designed so that when a person submits a story through “Add a story” function on the site, an email is sent to the contributor saying that the story is being reviewed and will be up shortly. Some curated stories on the map have been linked together as a sort of tour around thematic topics.
Digital technology is used remotely to build an on-line database of memories, accessible by the cityofmemory.org website. The stories can be accessed principally in two ways: by location (navigating the map to where the story occurred) or by title (typing a part of or the whole name into the search bar). Stories, although located on a map, are not geo-referenced: each story is in fact pinned to a location on the map, which is only a tool to navigate through web content. There is not a comment board platform that would allow web users to interact each other about issues raised from the memories narrated.
The website, connecting stories geographically and thematically creates synergies among them and presents each single contribute as a part of a virtual comprehensive story of NYC. This project is the implementation of the Memory Maps project realized in 2001 (for the realization of which no technology was used) and its virtual transposition thanks to digital technologies, which allow making ubiquitous on the Web the call “tell us your story”.","Interpretation - (curatorial tool, catalogue) - key function of technologies is to help in the exposition of existing informational platforms",Off Site - not related to museum premises,Independent from the Visit - no relation to the visit ,Text|Audio|Image|Video,"Stories, although located on a map, are not geo-referenced: each story is in fact pinned to a location on the map, which is only a tool to navigate through web content.
There are just three levels for zooming (wide, medium, close), and there are no filters for time or other content features. Some elements of the graphical hierarchy work well, primarily the bright and bold colors contrasted against a grey background, but the base map, when zoomed in, fails to expand at all to include additional labels or references in relationship to the space. According to Jake Barton, the map is purposely designed so that readers can’t see much about the specific location of any individual story without zooming in twice because it is more of an organizing feature than an informational one.
The legend is simple, only identifying two types of points for curated or user-submitted content and there are a few other standard cartographic elements present, including title, institutional affiliation, project funders, and labeled key elements.
The website is build in Flash (proprietary software) and presents video clips, images, and text-based stories. It is not optimized for mobile and tablet and present the typical mechanic of interaction for a classical website (option selection and responses on mouse click).
The proposed model of interaction does not permit individuals engage with other nor physically, nor virtually, due to the impossibility for the web users to leave a comment (nor moderated) on the stories and in this way virtually interact with other users.","Audience / Public - the application is outward facing, intended as an experience for the general public, or specific community groups","City of Memory is an-open ended site, which has his roots in the 1960s initiatives that celebrated the stories of ordinary people, among which the Smithsonian Institution’s Festival of American Folklife (where the early version of the project was featured) and for which Zeitlin worked in the 1970s creating a tent in which anyone could come in and record family stories. Through the practice of storytelling, the aim of City Lore is to create a repository that could protect the identity and the memory of the intangible heritage represented. Stories are presented substantially without any interpretative filter, also for the curated stories, that are simply selected among the others (because more interesting or attracting for audience) and better and more professionally narrated. There is no evidence of a further level of interpretation of these memories or of a renegotiation of narrated identities because the comparison among different stories and a deeper inquiry about cultural issues of narrated memories are missing in this storytelling practice.
The project proposes implicitly a cultural friction about the content itself of narrated stories. By exploring the cognitive maps of the city that each of the witnesses (and of the users) has in his head, different representations and interpretations of history events, places and people emerge.","The entire project is based on a participatory approach in audience engagement: the stories and the memories are in fact personal and first person narrated episodes related to a specific place of the city in a specific time and context. Anyone can upload each story on the site, through the “Add story” button in the home page and filling in a simple form and City Lore often works with New Yorkers to help with videotaping, editing and uploading their stories that in this case are based on personal interviews and carefully edited. In addition, the site is periodically re-curated, leaving only the more interesting and substantive entries up permanently, eliminating stories to which contributors did not give significant tome or thought.","City of Memory highlights the tension between curation and participation (public curation). The goal is to be inclusive and participatory, but without giving up to create a meaningful and engaging experience for visitors. A website that simply allowed all contributions and where stories are presented without any interpretive key, would probably become simply the sum of its parts and would be an unsatisfying experience for visitors.",,Individual interactions are networked in aggregate,4,Collaborative (focused on making visitors build knowledge together),5,3,,"A plural representation, mindful to multiple (and dissenting) voices of individuals",1) Multi-Cultural Storytelling - representing different cultures alongside but separate to one another,People from the same cultures as those represented,"Both, with respect to different parts of the museum/exhibition/project","Both, with respect to different parts of the museum/exhibition/project",Yes,No,3

Since 2003, StoryCorps has collected and archived more than 40,000 interviews from more than 60,000 participants. StoryCorps is one of the largest oral history projects of its kind, and millions listen to our weekly broadcasts on NPR’s Morning Edition and on our Listen pages.” (Retrieved from “About us” section on StoryCorps website).
The program models itself after an activity of the Works Progress Administration (wpa) of the 1930s, the federal project that recorded oral history interviews with average Americans across the nation. Calling the wpa oral histories “the single most important collection of American voices gathered to date,” StoryCorps seeks to become a wpa project for the twenty-first century.
The Sound Portraits Productions (http://soundportraits.org/about/) was the predecessor to StoryCorps, first established as a not-for-profit corporation in 1994 by MacArthur Fellow David Isay. Sound Portraits Productions was an independent production company dedicated to telling stories that bring neglected American voices to a national audience. Whether on the radio, in print, or on the Web, Sound Portraits was committed to producing innovative works of lasting educational, cultural, and artistic value.
StoryCorps began with a StoryBooth in Grand Central Terminal, which opened on October 2003, and closed on May 2008 recording more than 5,000 stories from both New Yorkers and visitors from across the country.
In 2004 StoryCorps launches its two MobileBooths, traveling recording studios housed in Airstream trailers, from the Library of Congress. By mid 2008, they will have recorded stories in all lower 48 states.
Since July 2005, StoryCorps and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum have worked to record at least one story to honor each life lost in the attacks on September 11, 2001 and February 26, 1993. To date, StoryCorps has recorded and archived 1193 September 11th stories, representing 583 individual victims.
Since 2006, StoryCorps’ Memory Loss Initiative has supported and encouraged people with various forms of memory loss to share their stories with loved ones and future generations. To date, the Memory Loss Initiative collected more than 1,800 interviews with 180 partner organizations. 
In January 2007 a StoryBooth was opened in Milwaukee and months later, another in Nashville.
In 2007 was launched the StoryCorps Griot initiative to ensure that the voices, experiences, and life stories of African Americans will be preserved and presented with dignity. In September 2008 the Griot Initiative surpasses the 2,300 interviews gathered as part of the WPA slave narratives of the 1930s to become the largest collection of African American stories in history.
In April 2008 the flagship StoryBooth in Grand Central Terminal closes, and the new flagship StoryBooth opens in Lower Manhattan’s Foley Square. In 2008 StoryCorps opens a StoryBooth in San Francisco, in partnership with the Contemporary Jewish Museum. From October 2008, through April 2009, the special initiative StoryCorps Alaska traveled to Fairbanks, Nome, Barrow, Dillingham, Unalaska, Juneau, and other communities to record and preserve the diverse stories of Alaskans and in 2009 StoryCorps opens a StoryBooth in Atlanta, in partnership with WABE.
In 2008 StoryCorps launches the first annual National Day of Listening, inspiring tens of thousands of Americans to record and preserve conversations with loved ones during the holidays and in 2009 StoryCorps Historias was launches as initiative to honor and celebrate Latino stories.","Interpretation - (curatorial tool, catalogue) - key function of technologies is to help in the exposition of existing informational platforms",On Site - in dedicated areas,During the vist - enhancing visitor experience,Audio,"The expected audience of StoryCorps programme is all the Americans, both for the people recorded (the participants) and for the public who listen to the radio editing excerpts.
Digital technology is used for recording the interviews in the dedicated booth. Each session last about forty minutes at the end of which the facilitator takes a photo of the participants and hands them a cardboard sleeve containing a CD copy of the interview. A second copy is sent to Washington, DC, to be archived at the Library of the Congress’s American Folklife Center.
The used devices are simple: to record a story essentially are needed only a professional digital recorder, a professional-quality microphone and a studio-grade headphones. As well as in the dedicated booth, it is possible to rent a StoryKit, designed for individuals and families to capture stories at home much like those that take place in the booths.
It is possible to listen to the selected and curated stories on NPR’s Morning Edition and on StoryCorps website “Listen pages” (http://storycorps.org/listen). Furthermore StoryBooth has a number of “Listening Stations”, encouraging people to put their ears against the booths for sample stories. However in all this cases is not possible for the passive audience to have any degree of interaction in regard to the proposed content and the experience of fruition is essentially a solo experience, that does not promote any individually engage with other nor physically, nor virtually.
The case presents a low level of technology, but the value added deriving from the use of it is essential as enabler of the experience. It would be not possible to have the same results without using a digital system of recording and broadcasting.","Audience / Public - the application is outward facing, intended as an experience for the general public, or specific community groups","StoryCorps’s stories propose a cultural friction through the narrated content, which implicitly represents a specific point of view and a subjective interpretation of a particular episode in the framework of the American history.
Featured special projects are dedicated to specific issues, described thought the American voices and their singular memories and experiences:
-	The StoryCorps Griot initiative ensures that the life stories of African Americans will be preserved and presented with dignity; a Griot (pronounced gree-oh) is a storyteller, a position of honor in West African tradition, who hands down family and community history from one generation to the next. All interviews recorded as part of the Griot Initiative will be archived at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History & Culture in addition to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. 
-	StoryCorps Historias was launches as initiative to honor and celebrate Latino stories.
-	StoryCorps Alaska traveled to Fairbanks, Nome, Barrow, Dillingham, Unalaska, Juneau, and other communities to record and preserve the diverse stories of Alaskans.
-	Since July 2005, StoryCorps and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum have worked to record at least one story to honor each life lost in the attacks on September 11, 2001 and February 26, 1993.
-	The Memory Loss Initiative has created a toolkit called Commemorate, designed to help organizations record, share, and preserve the stories of clients living with memory loss. The Commemorate Toolkit (downloadable from http://storycorps.org/initiatives/mli/) offers memory loss care facilities across the country a new individualized reminiscence program they can add to their existing roster of person-centered care activities. Offering Commemorate interviews to people living with memory loss can enhance bonds between clients, caregivers, and staff and reduce common feelings of isolation and low self-esteem. These interviews also offer clients and their families the opportunity to preserve the legacy of individuals living with memory loss.","The model of audience participation proposed by StoryCorps provides an open space for the exchange of stories with no comment or mediation, but the conclusion people draw from hearing other people’s stories or telling their own, can have no effect at all, or even confirm their worst prejudice. Sevcenko (2011), also referring to the StoryCorps project, questions about the role of museum should have in promote a deeper dialogue among diverse people; “I think museums do have the potential to do more than just validate everyone and everything and instead to tease out some of the power dimension or the political questions that people’s stories raise.” (Tchen & Sevcenko 2011, p.90).","This case opens to a reflection about different approaches in curating contents contributed by the public. It starts with raw content: interviews can be about anything and more than 40,000 interviews are archived at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress without any curatorial intervention, but this row material for the moment is not a resource accessible or usable by the public in any way. The curator-curated material is used instead for the NPR’s Morning Edition, which every Friday presents a highly refined extract of a story. Frisch (2011) identifies this dichotomy – raw vs. “cooked” UGC as “the classic fate of 20th century oral history”, highlighting the contradiction “to have raw interview in a distant archive with uneven metadata and almost no exploratory capacity, and highly polished extracts of a tiny, tiny fraction of that rich documentation.” (Frisch 2011, pp.135–136).",,Individual interactions are networked in aggregate,1,Reflective (focused on engaging visitors cognitively),3,3,,A unitary representation (monolithic),1) Multi-Cultural Storytelling - representing different cultures alongside but separate to one another,"Both, with respect to different parts of the museum/exhibition/project","Both, with respect to different parts of the museum/exhibition/project",Emphasis on the protection of the identity and memory of the culture/s represented (nationalism and patriotism),Yes,Yes,3

It will feature a wide range of objects from all over the world, from interfaces and products to diagrams, visualizations, perhaps even vehicles and furniture, by bona-fide designers, students, scientists, all designed in the past few years or currently under development. The exhibition hinges on an important development in the culture of design, a shift from the centrality of function to that of meaning. From this perspective, all objects contain information that goes well beyond their immediate use or appearance. In some cases, objects exist to provide us with access to complex systems and networks, behaving as gateways and interpreters. Whether openly and actively, or in subtle, subliminal ways, things talk to us, and designers help us develop and improvise the dialogue. Talk to Me will focus on objects that involve a direct interaction, such as interfaces, information systems, visualization design, communication devices, and projects that establish an emotional, sensual, or intellectual connection with their users, ranging from the early 1980s all the way to projects in current development (the bulk of the show).

Wide space is dedicated also to the importance of food consumption as a moment of sharing and to the importance of conviviality.

C.
The exhibition is organized as an itinerary in various (18) multimedia stops that correspond to 12 places celebrating existing legs of the journey: Palmira, Ctesifonte, Taq-e Bostan, Merv, Samarcanda, Ghazni, Kucha, Turfan, Dunhuang, Chang’an and the localities of Tur ‘Abdin and Swat. In the places narrated in the exhibition different populations for provenance, religions, traditions were living and often they found along the Silk route occasion for living together in respect and tolerance or for culturally contaminate each other. For instance the three big religions Buddhism, Christianity and Islam co-existed pacifically along the route. Through the use of interactive installations is possible to explore the complexity of this cultural system connecting real objects on show (100 archeological finds of different typology coming from various institutions, museums, libraries) with stories and characters of the past. In particular two important documents are displayed: Marco Polo Bible and a Mongolia Map of XIV century. The wooden chests, usually used to archive archeological material, are here used as metaphor of the journey and support of the video-installations. The video give voices to otherwise silent patrimony of objects.

Anyway the exhibition mixes structured and formalized way of interaction (flipping pages) with unconscious but formalized behaviors (approaching a screen or a case) with conscious but informal behaviors (occupying the space, or blowing on a feather).
The model of interaction enabled by technologies is not directly promoting an extra engagement of the visitor than simply experiencing the content (listening and seeing) that continues until the visitor moves away; there is not social engangement but it can happen naturally that other visitors get close to the installation and share the experience.","Audience / Public - the application is outward facing, intended as an experience for the general public, or specific community groups","The contents of the exhibition are cultural, so the reflection about culture is proposed through the topic that offers a perspective on a multi and intercultural context and heritage system.

In this sense the exhibition is an examples of a plural representation of multiple voices. Anyway they result to be inserted in a single big narrative with no “dissenting” voices.

This case reports an experience that started in 1990 within the (at that time called) Chinatown History Museum with the exhibition Memories of New York Chinatown and lasts until now with the recent installation of “environmental media” by Local project in 2009 (design firm that designs interactive media installations for museums and public spaces) within the MoCA museum.
In winter 2012 will be launched Digital MoCA, an extension of MoCA’s permanent exhibit “With A Single Step”, an interactive, dynamic timeline that will present  thousands of historical records that will tell the stories of 400+ years of Chinese American history and the impact Chinese have made on American culture, society, and economy.
The Memory of New York Chinatown exhibition is dated 1990, but it’s one of the more advanced concept, in the nineties, of a dialogic approach in designing the experience of social cultural memories. In that time, it was under discussion, within the conference Museum and communities at the Smithsonian Institute of Washington, the role of museums in the representation of contemporary collective culture. In this theoretical context, the exhibition Memories of New York Chinatown, opened in 1991 in the Chinatown History Museum, provided an innovative and emblematic dialogic approach of documentation of the history of the Chinese community of New York, its oral tradition, social practices and craftsmanship, being designed and realized in order to promote an exchange process between public and curator in which people was involved and participated in the knowledge and interpretation of their own history (Kuo Wei Tchen, 1990).

","Interpretation - (curatorial tool, catalogue) - key function of technologies is to help in the exposition of existing informational platforms",On Site - near objects and exhibits,During the vist - enhancing visitor experience,Text|Image,"The use of technology within the museum has always been connected with dialogic and participative modalities: for this reason beside to interactive technologies there are been present analogical collaborative modalities (public dialogues, reunions, conversations…). In addition, at the foundation of the museum (1991) the dialogic station used what can be today considered “low tech” devices. The interaction was supplied in different modules and by different media: photos, documents, maps. Stimulated by the suggestions or questions of an operator, the public interrogated (using a computer or a card index) directly the database and added its personal comments.","Audience / Public - the application is outward facing, intended as an experience for the general public, or specific community groups","Through an ongoing and historical dialogue that shapes MoCA\'s collections, programs and exhibitions, people of all backgrounds are able to explore the diversity and complexity of our history and culture, while gaining unique access to the images, papers, oral histories and artifacts which document the story.
The MoCA presents cultural arguments and issues on Chinese integration in America as core content of all its activities and exhibitions. The approach that has been used along the years is principally the promotion of an inter-cultural dialogue between the Chinese immigrants and the NY community, but especially at the beginning, among Chinese immigrants themselves, who were disconnected each other (immigrants from Hong Kong and Canton or older rural areas), didn’t communicate and didn’t recognize themselves as a community with common values and similar life conditions.
The model of valorization of the Chinese identity is a mixed combination of musealisation and continuous reproduction and re-negotiation of history. In fact the museum promotes dynamics of self and multiple representation where people is asked to express his voices and opinions, and this lead to the concept of an identity in becoming itself where the re-contextualisation of an originary dislocated community and individual stories is accompanied by the 2° and 3° generation immigrant residents integration within the America society.

It’s a journey of exploration and comparison of diverse cultures that covers an area of 3,600 square meters spread out over three floors, structured as a sequence of varied spatial experiences, narrative and scenic spaces, individual chapters that give access to various world cultures.
The exhibit space is divided in two areas entitled \""Shaping the World\"" and \""Understanding the World\"", each of which is subdivided into several theme-based subsections: it’s an innovative multimedia exhibition concept designed to be as engaging as informative, involving visitors in different museum experiences for each room.
Fourteen highly scenic rooms relating to everyday life and festival culture from different regions of the earth encourage the visitor to recognize the equal rights and equal value of different ways of life.
","Interpretation - (curatorial tool, catalogue) - key function of technologies is to help in the exposition of existing informational platforms",On Site - near objects and exhibits,During the vist - enhancing visitor experience,Text|Audio|Image|Video,"The level of interaction proposed by multimedia installations is quite low, sometimes relying on a simple choice of contents and sometimes on passive contents’ consumption.
The user experience provided by the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum, indeed, does not rely heavily on technologies but on their perfect integration within the scenic context of the rooms, sometimes hiding and something being featured.
","Audience / Public - the application is outward facing, intended as an experience for the general public, or specific community groups","People in Their Worlds is a noteworthy example of integration of ICT and multimedia within the exhibition space, as a common piece of exhibition to be carefully mixed with the other. Technology is not something added to the space in order to get a “wow” effect nor something that completely overarches the exhibit but rather something fully integrated in the space.
The project proposes therefore another way of addressing the relation between visitors and space mediated by technology, but it’s also relevant for Mela because it addresses issues related to culture, diversity and integration.
