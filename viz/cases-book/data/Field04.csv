The archive conserves the documentation produced by the Museum starting in 1986 (when Reina Sofía began operations as an Art Centre) and up through the present. It also conserves a small part of the documentation produced by the Museo Español de Arte Contemporáneo and by the bodies that preceded it, in addition to the documentation transferred periodically by the different units within the Museum. It currently holds 7000 storage units.
It began functioning in 2008 and thus is still in the process of organising the documentation. However, it has some basic description instruments that enable it to serve the institution as well as external users, the only restrictions being those imposed by its state of organisation and by the general legislation concerning access to archives.
Services
1) Consulting documentation
To consult the documentation in person it is necessary only to present an official identification document and fill in the printed researcher sheet as well as the request form for the documentation you wish to consult.
2) Reproducing documents
Users can also request photocopies and take photographs or make digital copies using their own devices. In both cases, reproduction is subject to the state of conservation of the documents and to the provisions laid down in the applicable legislation. If the reproductions are to be used for purposes other than research (advertising, publication, exhibition) an agreement to this effect must be signed with the Museum.
