Audiences chose one of a number of given identities as their persona and they then followed their persona’s route through a diverse, but always brutal and uncertain journey. While the route was clearly ‘scripted’, obviously the interpretation, the emotional intensity and latent violence with which the script was carried out, was literally in hands of the actors and their improvisations.\""
